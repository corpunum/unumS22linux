# Native Init Experiments — 2026-09-18/19 session

## Summary
Attempted to replace Android's AOSP `/init` with a custom native-Linux init in the
recovery ramdisk, using the proven-working LineageOS kernel/DTB/DTBO. Every variant
that replaces `/init` crash-loops identically (static bootloader splash → reset,
repeating, no observable kernel/userspace output, empty pstore every time). The one
thing that has ever booted successfully all session is the real, untouched AOSP `/init`.

## Isolation results, most to least recent

| Build | What changed vs. known-good | Result |
|---|---|---|
| V11 | Untouched `/init`, added one harmless extra file to ramdisk | **BOOTS FINE** |
| Control test | Untouched kernel+ramdisk+dtb+dtbo, repacked via our own tooling | **BOOTS FINE** |
| V10 | `/init` = tiny static C binary (mount+kmsg+cache-log+loop), everything else removed | crash-loop |
| V9 | V8 + fixed cache mount to use raw `/dev/block/sda33` instead of nonexistent by-name symlink | crash-loop, still zero log |
| V8 | V7 + `insmod s3c2410_wdt.ko` first (watchdog-feed theory) | crash-loop |
| V7 | V6 + attempted persistent cache logging (used broken by-name path, so no log ever written) | crash-loop |
| V6 | `/init` = minimal busybox ash script (mount + kmsg + infinite loop), busybox correctly named | crash-loop (survived longer than pre-fix builds per USB timing, unconfirmed) |
| V4 | Exact working ramdisk (sepolicy, lib64, everything intact), ONLY `/init` swapped to busybox script (busybox misnamed `native_busybox` at this point) | crash-loop |
| V2/V3 | Full ramdisk replacement, 324 then 12 modules, busybox misnamed | crash-loop |

## Confirmed bugs found and fixed along the way (real, but not the root cause)
1. **Missing AVB footer**: our first custom images had no AVB footer at all, causing a
   distinct earlier failure (`SVB Fail! recovery: No footer detected`) visible on-screen
   before the kernel was even reached. Fixed by adding `avbtool add_hash_footer
   --algorithm NONE --rollback_index 0`, matching LineageOS's own BoardConfig exactly.
2. **Busybox argv[0]/multicall bug**: naming the binary `native_busybox` broke busybox's
   applet dispatch (`argv[0]` must be `busybox` or a known applet name), causing
   `applet not found`, exit 127, PID 1 death, kernel panic. Reproduced and confirmed
   locally via `qemu-aarch64-static -0`. Real bug, fixed by naming it `/busybox`.
3. **Broken persistent logging**: `/dev/block/by-name/cache` doesn't exist without
   `ueventd` running (those symlinks are created by it, not by devtmpfs alone). Fixed
   by using the raw device (`/dev/block/sda33`) directly. Even after fixing this, no
   log was ever produced by any custom-init build — see open issues below.
4. **vbmeta DOES chain-reference the recovery partition** (`Chain Partition descriptor`,
   rollback index 1, keyed to the stock signing key) — confirmed via `avbtool
   info_image` on the stock vbmeta. However this applies equally to LineageOS's own
   working recovery (also `algorithm NONE`, unsigned) and the bootloader is unlocked
   (AVB failures warn, don't block), so this does not explain the differential
   success/failure we're seeing. Real finding, not the root cause.

## What's now conclusively ruled out
- Module loading content/order/count (V2 with 324 modules and V3 with 12 both failed
  identically; V10 with zero modules also failed identically)
- Busybox/shell-specific bugs (V10's pure static C binary failed identically)
- Our image-packaging pipeline / mkbootimg+avbtool arguments (control test + V11 both
  succeed using the same pipeline)
- General ramdisk content modification / any-change-breaks-verification (V11 succeeds
  with a modified ramdisk, real `/init` untouched)

## What remains genuinely open
The failure is narrowed to "replacing what runs as PID 1" specifically, on this exact
kernel, but the mechanism is unconfirmed. Leading candidates from external review
(3 independent AI consultations, saved in `initramfs/nativev5_notes_for_sol.md` and
`initramfs/update_for_sol.md`, cross-model responses in `~/ttta/`):
- An early kernel/bootloader hand-off issue specific to how `run_init_process()`
  interacts with something the real AOSP init does immediately (SELinux policy load,
  a specific mount, a specific watchdog pet) that a replacement program doesn't
  replicate, one we haven't yet identified.
- Possibly Samsung DEFEX (Defeat Exploit LSM) - though this is disputed: DEFEX is not
  typically present in third-party GKI-style kernels like the LineageOS build we're
  using, which weakens this theory, but hasn't been definitively ruled out (would need
  to grep the actual kernel source/config for `defex` symbols to settle it).
- Our own logging methodology was unvalidated: no `fsync()`/`O_SYNC` on cache writes
  (page-cache writes are lost on a hard reset regardless of whether the program ran
  fine), no `/dev/console` node created in any custom ramdisk (so even a kernel-level
  panic message had nowhere to land that we were capturing), and pstore was never
  validated as working on this device via a deliberate known-good crash-and-recover
  test. This means "zero evidence survived" is NOT strong evidence of "crashed
  immediately" - it may simply reflect broken instrumentation.

## Recommended next steps (not yet attempted)
1. **Fix the instrumentation first**: create `/dev/console` (c 5 1) in any future custom
   ramdisk, use `O_SYNC`/`fsync()` for the cache log, and validate pstore/last_kmsg
   actually works on THIS kernel by deliberately crashing a known-good (real-init) boot
   (`echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger`) and confirming the crash is readable afterward.
2. **`panic=` as a free oracle**: build the same failing custom-init image twice, once
   with `panic=5` and once with `panic=60` on the cmdline. If the reset timing changes
   between the two, the kernel IS running and genuinely panicking (userspace-triggered).
   If the timing doesn't change at all, the kernel likely never reaches that point,
   pointing to an earlier hand-off failure.
3. **Grep the kernel source for `defex`** to settle whether that specific Samsung LSM
   is compiled into this exact kernel build, one way or the other, instead of debating
   it without evidence.
4. **Real UART console** (if a 619kΩ ID-resistor jig or similar is ever available) would
   settle all of this immediately - `console=ttySAC0,115200 earlycon initcall_debug`.
5. **Pragmatic path forward in the meantime**: keep the real AOSP `/init`, inject our
   own code later via a custom `init.rc` service definition (started after SELinux/
   mounts/ueventd are already up), get a working log/exec path end-to-end using the
   known-good environment, then work backward - moving code earlier and earlier until
   the actual boundary that breaks is found, rather than continuing to guess blind at
   full `/init` replacement.

## Session state at stop
Phone is safely on LineageOS recovery (V11 build - which is functionally identical to
official Lineage recovery, so no distinction from stock behavior). No physical damage,
one fully-recovered incident (MISC secure-check failure, documented in
evidence/lineage_recovery_boot/MILESTONE.md and FLASH_LOG.md). All artifacts, builds,
and full firmware/toolchain preserved on disk under ~/s22-linux/ for continuation.
